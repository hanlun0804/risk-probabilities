# Risk probabilities

Risk is a boardgame where the goal is to control the world. A player gains an area on the board by attacking another player, and winning their territory. The attacker throws three dice. Based on what the attacker throws, the defender can choose to defend with one or two dice. The attacker's top dice goes against the defender's top dice. If the defender uses two dice, the second dice goes against the attacker's next best dice. If the dice from the attacker and the defender are the same, the defender wins that battle. 

This program lets you enter a pair of dice (what the attacker throws), and based on 1000 random throws it tells you, as the defender, should choose to play with one or two dice. 

Spoilers: If the attacker throws 6 and 4, you should throw with one dice. If the attacker throws 5 and 5, you should throw 2 dice.
